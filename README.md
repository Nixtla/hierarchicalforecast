**HierarchicalForecast** offers a collection of reconciliation methods, including `BottomUp`, `TopDown`, `MiddleOut`, `MinTrace` and `ERM`. And Probabilistic coherent predictions including `Normality`, `Bootstrap`, and `PERMBU`.

## üìö Intro
A vast amount of time series datasets are organized into structures with different levels or hierarchies of aggregation. Examples include categories, brands, or geographical groupings. Coherent forecasts across levels are necessary for consistent decision-making and planning. Hierachical Forecast offers differnt reconciliation methods that render coherent forecasts across hierachies. 
Until recent, this methods were mainly avaiable in the R ecosystem. This Python-based framework aims to bridge the gap between statistical modeling and Machine Learning in the time series field.

## üéä Features 

* Classic reconciliation methods:
    - `BottomUp`: Simple addition to the upper levels.
    - `TopDown`: Distributes the top levels forecasts trough the hierarchies.
* Alternative reconciliation methods:
    - `MiddleOut`: It anchors the base predictions in a middle level. The levels above the base predictions use the bottom-up approach, while the levels below use a top-down.
    - `MinTrace`: Minimizes the total forecast variance of the space of coherent forecasts, with the Minimum Trace reconciliation.
    - `ERM`: Optimizes the reconciliation matrix minimizing an L1 regularized objective.
* Probabilistic coherent methods:
    - `Normality`: Uses MinTrace variance-covariance closed form matrix under a normality assumption.
    - `Bootstrap`: Generates distribution of hierarchically reconciled predictions using Gamakumara's bootstrap approach.
    - `PERMBU`: Reconciles independent sample predictions by reinjecting multivariate dependence with estimated rank permutation copulas, and performing a Bottom-Up aggregation.

## üìñ Why? 

**Short**: We want to contribute to the ML field by providing reliable baselines and benchmarks for hierarchical forecasting task in industry and academia. Here's the complete [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03517).

**Verbose**: `HierarchicalForecast` integrates publicly available processed datasets, evaluation metrics, and a curated set of standard statistical baselines. In this library we provide usage examples and references to extensive experiments where we showcase the baseline's use and evaluate the accuracy of their predictions. With this work, we hope to contribute to Machine Learning forecasting by bridging the gap to statistical and econometric modeling, as well as providing tools for the development of novel hierarchical forecasting algorithms rooted in a thorough comparison of these well-established models. We intend to continue maintaining and increasing the repository, promoting collaboration across the forecasting community.

## üíª Installation

You can install `HierarchicalForecast`'s the Python package index [pip](https://pypi.org) with:

```python
pip install hierarchicalforecast
```

You can also can install `HierarchicalForecast`'s from [conda](https://anaconda.org) with:

```python
conda install -c conda-forge hierarchicalforecast
```


## üß¨ How to use

The following example needs `statsforecast` and `datasetsforecast` as additional packages. If not installed, install it via your preferred method, e.g. `pip install statsforecast datasetsforecast`.
The `datasetsforecast` library allows us to download hierarhical datasets and we will use `statsforecast` to compute the base forecasts to be reconciled.

You can open a complete example in Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nixtla/hierarchicalforecast/blob/main/nbs/examples/TourismSmall.ipynb)

Minimal Example:
```python
# !pip install -U numba statsforecast datasetsforecast
import pandas as pd

# compute base forecast no coherent
from statsforecast.core import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import AutoARIMA, Naive

#obtain hierarchical reconciliation methods and evaluation
from hierarchicalforecast.core import HierarchicalReconciliation
from hierarchicalforecast.methods import BottomUp, TopDown, MiddleOut

#obtain hierarchical datasets
from datasetsforecast.hierarchical import HierarchicalData

# Load TourismSmall dataset
Y_df, S, tags = HierarchicalData.load('./data', 'TourismSmall')
Y_df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(Y_df['ds'])


# Compute base level predictions 
sf = StatsForecast(df=Y_df, 
                   models=[AutoARIMA(season_length=12), Naive()], 
                   freq='M', n_jobs=-1)

forecasts_df = sf.forecast(h=12)

# Reconcile the base predictions
reconcilers = [
    BottomUp(),
    TopDown(method='forecast_proportions'),
    MiddleOut(middle_level='Country/Purpose/State',
              top_down_method='forecast_proportions')
]

hrec = HierarchicalReconciliation(reconcilers=reconcilers)

reconciled_forecasts = hrec.reconcile(Y_hat_df=forecasts_df, S=S, tags=tags)
```

### Evaluation
Assumes you have a test dataframe.

```python
from hierarchicalforecast.core import HierarchicalEvaluation

def mse(y, y_hat):
    return np.mean((y-y_hat)**2)

evaluator = HierarchicalEvaluation(evaluators=[mse])
evaluator.evaluate(Y_hat_df=Y_rec_df, Y_test=Y_test_df, 
                   tags=tags, benchmark='Naive')
```
