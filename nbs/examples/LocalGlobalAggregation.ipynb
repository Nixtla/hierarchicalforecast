    "- If all timeseries have the same length and same timestamps, `global` and `local` yield the same results.\n",
    "- The default behavior is `local`. This means that temporal aggregations between timeseries can't be compared unless the series have the same length and timestamp. This behavior is generally safer, and advised to use when time series are not necessarily related, and you are building per-series models using e.g. `StatsForecast`.\n",
    "- The `global` behavior can be useful when dealing with timeseries where we expect relationships between the timeseries. For example, in case of forecasting daily product demand individual products may not always have sales for all timesteps, but one is interested in the overall temporal yearly aggregation across all products. The `global` setting has more room for error, so be careful and check the aggregation result carefully. This would typically be the setting used in combination with models from `MLForecast` or `NeuralForecast`. "
