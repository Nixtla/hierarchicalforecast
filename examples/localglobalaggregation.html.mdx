title: Local vs Global Temporal Aggregation

In this notebook we explain the difference between temporally
aggregating timeseries locally and globally.

You can run these experiments using CPU or GPU with Google Colab.

```python
!pip install hierarchicalforecast utilsforecast
```

## 1. Generate Data

In this example we will generate synthetic series to explain the
difference between local- and global temporal aggregation. We will
generate 2 series with a daily frequency.


```python
from utilsforecast.data import generate_series
```


```python
freq = "D"
n_series = 2
df = generate_series(n_series=n_series, 
                     freq=freq, 
                     min_length=2 * 365, 
                     max_length=4 * 365,  
                     equal_ends=True)
```

Note that our two timeseries do not have the same number of timesteps:


```python
df.groupby('unique_id', observed=True)["ds"].count()
```

``` text
unique_id
0    1414
1    1289
Name: ds, dtype: int64
```

We then define a spec for our temporal aggregations.


```python
spec  = {"year": 365, "quarter": 91, "month": 30, "week": 7, "day": 1}
```

## 2. Local aggregation (default)

In local aggregation, we treat the timestamps of each timeseries
individually. It means that the temporal aggregation is performed by
only looking at the timestamps of each series, disregarding the
timestamps of other series.


```python
from hierarchicalforecast.utils import aggregate_temporal
```


```python
Y_df_local, S_df_local, tags_local = aggregate_temporal(df, spec)
```

We have created temporal aggregations *per timeseries*, as the temporal
aggregation `month-1` doesn’t correspond to the same (year, month) for
both timeseries. This is because the series with `unique_id=1` is
shorter and has its first datapoint in July 2000, in contrast to the
series with `unique_id=0`, which is longer and has its first timestamp
in March 2000.


```python
Y_df_local.query("temporal_id == 'month-1'")
```

|     | temporal_id | unique_id | ds         | y         |
|-----|-------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 39  | month-1     | 0         | 2000-03-16 | 93.574676 |
| 87  | month-1     | 1         | 2000-07-19 | 91.506421 |

## 2. Global aggregation

In global aggregation, we examine all unique timestamps across all
timeseries, and base our temporal aggregations on the unique list of
timestamps across all timeseries. We can specify the aggregation type by
setting the `aggregation_type` attritbue in
[`aggregate_temporal`](https://Nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/src/utils.html#aggregate_temporal).


```python
Y_df_global, S_df_global, tags_globval = aggregate_temporal(df, spec, aggregation_type="global")
```

We have created temporal aggregations *across all timeseries*, as the
temporal aggregation `month-1` corresponds to the same (year,
month)-combination for both timeseries. Since `month-1` isn’t present in
the second timeseries (as it is shorter), we have only one record for
the aggregation.


```python
Y_df_global.query("temporal_id == 'month-1'")
```

|     | temporal_id | unique_id | ds         | y         |
|-----|-------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 39  | month-1     | 0         | 2000-03-16 | 93.574676 |

For `month-5` however, we have a record for both timeseries, as the
second series has its first datapoint in that month.


```python
Y_df_global.query("temporal_id == 'month-5'")
```

|     | temporal_id | unique_id | ds         | y         |
|-----|-------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 43  | month-5     | 0         | 2000-07-14 | 95.169659 |
| 87  | month-5     | 1         | 2000-07-14 | 74.502584 |

Hence, the global aggregation ensures temporal alignment across all
series.

## 3. What to choose?

-   If all timeseries have the same length and same timestamps, `global`
    and `local` yield the same results.
-   The default behavior is `local`. This means that temporal
    aggregations between timeseries can’t be compared unless the series
    have the same length and timestamp. This behavior is generally
    safer, and advised to use when time series are not necessarily
    related, and you are building per-series models using
    e.g. `StatsForecast`.
-   The `global` behavior can be useful when dealing with timeseries
    where we expect relationships between the timeseries. For example,
    in case of forecasting daily product demand individual products may
    not always have sales for all timesteps, but one is interested in
    the overall temporal yearly aggregation across all products. The
    `global` setting has more room for error, so be careful and check
    the aggregation result carefully. This would typically be the
    setting used in combination with models from `MLForecast` or
    `NeuralForecast`.
