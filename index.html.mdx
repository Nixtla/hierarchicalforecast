title: "Hierarchical Forecast \U0001F451"
---


Large collections of time series organized into structures at different
aggregation levels often require their forecasts to follow their
aggregation constraints, which poses the challenge of creating novel
algorithms capable of coherent forecasts.

**HierarchicalForecast** offers a collection of reconciliation methods,
including
[`BottomUp`](https://Nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/methods.html#bottomup),
[`TopDown`](https://Nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/methods.html#topdown),
[`MiddleOut`](https://Nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/methods.html#middleout),
[`MinTrace`](https://Nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/methods.html#mintrace)
and
[`ERM`](https://Nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/methods.html#erm).
And Probabilistic coherent predictions including
[`Normality`](https://Nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/probabilistic_methods.html#normality),
[`Bootstrap`](https://Nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/probabilistic_methods.html#bootstrap),
and
[`PERMBU`](https://Nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/probabilistic_methods.html#permbu).

## ðŸŽŠ Features

-   Classic reconciliation methods:
    -   `BottomUp`: Simple addition to the upper levels.
    -   `TopDown`: Distributes the top levels forecasts trough the
        hierarchies.
-   Alternative reconciliation methods:
    -   `MiddleOut`: It anchors the base predictions in a middle level.
        The levels above the base predictions use the bottom-up
        approach, while the levels below use a top-down.
    -   `MinTrace`: Minimizes the total forecast variance of the space
        of coherent forecasts, with the Minimum Trace reconciliation.
    -   `ERM`: Optimizes the reconciliation matrix minimizing an L1
        regularized objective.
-   Probabilistic coherent methods:
    -   `Normality`: Uses MinTrace variance-covariance closed form
        matrix under a normality assumption.
    -   `Bootstrap`: Generates distribution of hierarchically reconciled
        predictions using Gamakumaraâ€™s bootstrap approach.
    -   `PERMBU`: Reconciles independent sample predictions by
        reinjecting multivariate dependence with estimated rank
        permutation copulas, and performing a Bottom-Up aggregation.

## ðŸ“– Why?

**Short**: We want to contribute to the ML field by providing reliable
baselines and benchmarks for hierarchical forecasting task in industry
and academia. Hereâ€™s the complete
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03517).

**Verbose**: `HierarchicalForecast` integrates publicly available
processed datasets, evaluation metrics, and a curated set of statistical
baselines. In this library we provide usage examples and references to
extensive experiments where we showcase the baselineâ€™s use and evaluate
the accuracy of their predictions. With this work, we hope to contribute
to Machine Learning forecasting by bridging the gap to statistical and
econometric modeling, as well as providing tools for the development of
novel hierarchical forecasting algorithms rooted in a thorough
comparison of these well-established models. We intend to continue
maintaining and increasing the repository, promoting collaboration
across the forecasting community.

## ðŸ’» Installation

### PyPI

You can install the *released version* of `HierarchicalForecast` from
the [Python package index](https://pypi.org) with:

```python
pip install hierarchicalforecast
```

(Installing inside a python virtualenvironment or a conda environment is
recommended.)

### Conda

Also you can install the *released version* of `HierarchicalForecast`
from [conda](https://anaconda.org) with:

```python
conda install -c conda-forge hierarchicalforecast
```

(Installing inside a python virtualenvironment or a conda environment is
recommended.)

### Dev Mode

If you want to make some modifications to the code and see the effects
in real time (without reinstalling), follow the steps below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nixtla/hierarchicalforecast.git
cd hierarchicalforecast
pip install -e .
```

## ðŸ§¬ How to use

The following example needs `statsforecast` and `datasetsforecast` as
additional packages. If not installed, install it via your preferred
method, e.g.Â `pip install statsforecast datasetsforecast`. The
`datasetsforecast` library allows us to download hierarhical datasets
and we will use `statsforecast` to compute base forecasts to be
reconciled.

Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nixtla/hierarchicalforecast/blob/main/nbs/examples/TourismSmall.ipynb)

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

#obtain hierarchical dataset
from datasetsforecast.hierarchical import HierarchicalData

# compute base forecast no coherent
from statsforecast.core import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import AutoARIMA, Naive

#obtain hierarchical reconciliation methods and evaluation
from hierarchicalforecast.core import HierarchicalReconciliation
from hierarchicalforecast.evaluation import HierarchicalEvaluation
from hierarchicalforecast.methods import BottomUp, TopDown, MiddleOut


# Load TourismSmall dataset
Y_df, S, tags = HierarchicalData.load('./data', 'TourismSmall')
Y_df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(Y_df['ds'])

#split train/test sets
Y_test_df  = Y_df.groupby('unique_id').tail(4)
Y_train_df = Y_df.drop(Y_test_df.index)

# Compute base auto-ARIMA predictions
fcst = StatsForecast(df=Y_train_df,
                     models=[AutoARIMA(season_length=4), Naive()],
                     freq='Q', n_jobs=-1)
Y_hat_df = fcst.forecast(h=4)

# Reconcile the base predictions
reconcilers = [
    BottomUp(),
    TopDown(method='forecast_proportions'),
    MiddleOut(middle_level='Country/Purpose/State',
              top_down_method='forecast_proportions')
]
hrec = HierarchicalReconciliation(reconcilers=reconcilers)
Y_rec_df = hrec.reconcile(Y_hat_df=Y_hat_df, Y_df=Y_train_df,
                          S=S, tags=tags)
```

### Evaluation

```python
def mse(y, y_hat):
    return np.mean((y-y_hat)**2)

evaluator = HierarchicalEvaluation(evaluators=[mse])
evaluator.evaluate(Y_hat_df=Y_rec_df, Y_test=Y_test_df.set_index('unique_id'),
                   tags=tags, benchmark='Naive')
```
